# ECO-DRIVE-INSIGHTS-HUB : -Tableau_Dashboard
 
Overview
Welcome to the ECO-DRIVE INSIGHTS HUB! This repository contains the project completed during my summer training course on SQL and Data Analytics at Programming Pathshala. The project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data related to the electric vehicle (EV) market, providing valuable insights into various aspects of the industry.

Project Highlights
Market Size and Growth Assessment: Conducted comprehensive data analysis using Tableau to explore the overall landscape of electric vehicles, including BEVs and PHEVs, and evaluate market size and growth trends.
Technological Advancements Analysis: Calculated the average electric range of EVs to provide insights into technological advancements and vehicle efficiency.
Market Share Evaluation: Identified and analyzed the total number of BEVs and PHEVs, calculating their respective percentages to understand their dominance and market relevance.
Geographic Leader: Highlighted California as the leader with 150,082 eco-friendly vehicles.
Skills Utilized
SQL: For data querying and manipulation to extract relevant information from the dataset.
Python: For data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and generating insights.
Tableau: For creating visualizations and dashboards to represent the analyzed data effectively.
Project Structure
Data: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks with data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization code.
Visualizations: Tableau dashboards and visualizations showcasing the insights derived from the data.
Future Work
Further analysis on other regions and their adoption of electric vehicles.
Comparative analysis of BEVs and PHEVs in terms of cost and efficiency.
Incorporating additional datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.
